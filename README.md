# An Explainable Continuous Verification Enabled Zero Trust Architecture for Characterizing Intrusion Behavior
# Abstract
With the continuously evolving cyber threats, traditional rule-based approaches of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) turn out to be inadequate in protecting complex network environments. This work addresses this gap by integrating Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) into an intrusion detection framework, adhering to the principles of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA). Continuous verification via behavioral analysis is implemented to maintain network security dynamically as new threats emerge. Our approach, based on the CIC-IDS2017 dataset, achieved an accuracy of 99.19% and an F1 score of 97.97% in distinguishing between normal and malicious traffic. To address the opaque nature of RL decision-making, we infused Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), for transparency in how the model makes its predictions. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining RL with ZTA principles to improve the resilience of IDS systems against sophisticated cyber threats.
